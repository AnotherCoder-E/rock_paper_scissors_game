1. get computer choice of rock, paper or scissors
    rock can be number 1, paper number 2 and scissors number 3

    with Math.random() and Math.floor() functions I will get
    a random integer between 1 and 3 and choose the assigned symbol

2. get user choice
    same situation as above but reversed
    user will input a string 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' and I will
    compare user's choice with the computer choice

How to compare player and computer result?
    If player choose rock and computer paper, how do I know that
    computer has won?

    I set matches for each sign, like:
    rock = rock draw
    rock > scissors
    rock < paper

    paper = paper draw
    paper > rock
    paper < scissors

    scissors = scissors draw
    scissors > paper
    scissors < rock

3. print result
    after comparing players choices I will type the winner and save
    scores of players

4. repeat for 5 rounds
    whole match should last 5 rounds with the player who won more rounds
    as a winner
